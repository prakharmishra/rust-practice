# Rust practice

This repo contains code samples I am using to practice Rust.

## first

This is the first binary project in Rust. I have tried exploring vars, functions, arguments and return type.

## second

In this, I practiced a little on conditionals in rust. I also encountered a curious conditional called `if let` which could unwrap the option for us.

## third

In this, I practiced loops. I looped infinitely, looped till I find an input from the user, looped over a range and vector.
