# Rust practice

This repo contains code samples I am using to practice Rust.

## first

This is the first binary project in Rust. I have tried exploring vars, functions, arguments and return type.

## second

In this, I practiced a little on conditionals in rust. I also encountered a curious conditional called `if let` which could unwrap the option for us.

## third

In this, I practiced loops. I looped infinitely, looped till I find an input from the user, looped over a range and vector.

## fourth

In this, I practiced match as a statement, answering user's prompts

## fifth

In this, I created a few hashmaps, one of them was string to string, another was int to string slice.
